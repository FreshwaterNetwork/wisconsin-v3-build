            'Groundwater dependent ecosystems (gde) are systems that depend on groundwater inputs to support their natural flora and fauna. These ecosystems can occur in wetlands, lakes and rivers. One rare gde is the fen, a wetland that depend mostly on groundwater inputs rather than surface water flows to support the wetland. The Mukwonago River Basin in southeast Wisconsin has several remaining fens that need careful protection. This tool is designed to help site high capacity groundwater wells in areas of the basin that protect a select group of important groundwater dependent ecosystems – fens, rivers and lakes – in the watershed. Impacts are reported in the drawdown experienced in fens or the depletion potential in rivers and lakes. The results presented are based off a groundwater model developed by the USGS, model documentation can be found here.',
